Many people lose themselves in their professional life and personal responsibilities. To be able to Cherish time with loved ones and 
friends becomes a top priority. Our team: Cherish created a mobile application to assist people by reminding them to connect with 
their loved ones and friends. 

The application itself was created by using Android Studio, Java programming language, and Agile methodolgy.


#### The video attched shows how the application runs on the emulator on Android Studio and this is how it will run on an android device.
